# Availity Submission
*Stephen Ulmer*

1. My proudest achievement is my Senior Design Project at the University of Central Florida. The goal was to create an iOS 
 application that took attendance using face recognition, but also used the social network of the class to improve the face
 recognition over time. The theory was that students in a classroom tend to either sit in the same seat, or sit with the
 same group of people.<br><br>My part in the project was to build the iOS application and Node.js REST API that stored pertinent
 data and used the OpenCV Computer Vision library for face recognition. I was also the Project Manager. The primary 
 obstacle was determining who sat next to each other with a single picture. My group investigated many approaches,
 including constructing 3D maps from multiple pictures, depth data from two pictures using the same camera. We then
 realized that the iPhone 8 had dual cameras which could extract the depth data itself. With the distance from the
 camera to two students, and the angle between the student and the camera, we had the ability to calculate the distance
 between the students.<br><br>After gathering test data, which was a simulation of a semester of classes, we were able to show
 that after a sufficient number of class meetings, the social data provided a noticeable improvement in face recognition
 accuracy. I am so proud of the project, because despite doubts from my team, we were able to find a way to achieve our
 goal. I also built an iPhone application and my first Node.js server for the project.<br><br>
 2. An article I read recently that had a great effect on me was [this](https://www.artima.com/intv/martin.html)
 interview by Bill Venners with Martin Fowler. More specifically, [the first part](https://www.artima.com/intv/refactor.html), 
 which discussed refactoring.<br><br>Refactoring is when code is changed, but maintains its existing behavior. The concept of
 refactoring is rather bland, but Martin Fowler's explanation of the benefits of refactoring, and the benefits of design
 to promote refactoring have been intriguing to me.<br><br>
 <b>Refactoring</b> allows code to be simplified, efficient, or meet the latest coding standards. <br><br>
 <b>Design</b> of code to be refactored encourages refactoring, which improves the code's quality. Breaking down code
 into smaller pieces allows it to be refactored easily.
  <br><br>
 <b>Tests</b> allow code to be refactored. Without tests, it is difficult to determine whether the
 behavior of the code has changed.<br><br>
 These three concepts are very simple, but profound. That's what makes them brilliant to me. Even if the reader of this
 response has a strong grasp of the benefits and methods of refactoring, this interview can be appreciated for Martin
 Fowler's ability to express the ideas so clearly.
